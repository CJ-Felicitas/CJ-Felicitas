### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I am a student at the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Information Security
- There's nothing much to see in here, most of my projects are in a closed source.

### I'm currently practicing
- php
- Vanilla JS
- Java
- HTML 5

I'm looking forward to learn Web Development and I'm more interested working on backend.<br>
And I'm not good at frontend
