### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I am a student at the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Information Security
I have basic skills and experience in developing web applications, my main tech stack is LAMP but I can easily adjust and learn from other stack.
I can also work with frontend frameworks such as Vue.js and React.js and my backend framework is Laravel

- There's nothing much to see in here, most of my projects are in a closed sourcee

As of now, I'm very interested to learn more about server management as well as handling servers that are hosted in the cloud.
