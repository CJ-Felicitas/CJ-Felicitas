### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I am a student at the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Information Security

- There's nothing much to see in here, most of my projects are in a closed source.

### I'm currently practicing
- PHP
- Javascript
- Java
- HTML5
- BS3
- MySQL
- NoSQL
- Laravel
- Vue.js
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Amazon Web Services
- Apache2
- Hyperledger Fabric (Blockchain Framework)
- GO
- Git

I'm not good at Node.js because I was trained using Laravel but I can work with JavaScript projects, I'm more interested in backend development since I'm not good at UI/UX design. As of this moment, I'm interested in working with projects that are related to distributed ledger technology (DLT) and Financial Technology (Fintech).
