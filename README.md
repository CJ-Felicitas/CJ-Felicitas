### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I am a student at the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Information Security
- There's nothing much to see in here, most of my projects are in a closed source.

### These are the things that I'm practicing
- php
- Vanilla JS
- Java
- HTML 5
- CSS3 (Actually I hate CSS3, I mostly use BS3 framework to make things easier)

I'm looking forward to learn Web Development
