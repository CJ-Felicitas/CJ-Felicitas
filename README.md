### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I am a student at the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Information Security
I have basic skills and experience in developing web applications, my main tech stack is LAMP but I can easily adjust and learn from other stack.
I can also work with frontend frameworks such as Vue.js and React.js and my backend framework is Laravel

- There's nothing much to see in here, most of my projects are in a closed sourcee

I'm not good at Node.js because I was trained using Laravel but I can work with JavaScript projects, I'm more interested in backend development since I'm not good at UI/UX design. As of this moment, I'm interested in working with projects that are related to distributed ledger technology (DLT) and Financial Technology (Fintech).
